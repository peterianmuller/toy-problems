// You are given an array of characters arr that consists of sequences of characters separated by space characters.
// Each space-delimited sequence of characters defines a word.
// Implement a function reverseWords that reverses the order of the words in the array in the most efficient manner.

// Problem taken from https://www.pramp.com/challenge/VKdqbrq6B1S5XAyGAOn4

// I : array of chars
// O : array of cars with words and letters in words reversed

function reverseWords(arr) {}

module.exports = reverseWords;
